NotaJE/scripts (The scripts will have the same structure of the styles, ex: menuScript or textboxScript)

NotaJE/styles (Our css styles, ex: menuStyle or textboxStyle)

NotaJE/assets/ (images, audios, and etc)

# About the project

The app will be a note taking app, with some simplicity but free and secure, private and obviously, will have some interesting stuff.

I want to focus on: Password Storing, so you can easily store your passwords offline and in a safe location, Folders to organize and a very familiar design. The first versions will be VERY SIMPLE, we will learn while work on the project! ^^

We need to use some effort on it, our first time working together!
