# About the project

The app will be a note taking app, with some simplicity but free and secure, private and obviously, will have some interesting stuff.

I want to focus on: Password Storing, so you can easily store your passwords offline and in a safe location, Folders to organize and a very familiar design. The first versions will be VERY SIMPLE, we will learn while work on the project! ^^
